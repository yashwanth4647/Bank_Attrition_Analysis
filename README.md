# Bank_Attrition_Analysis

**Jupyter Notebook**

**Overview**

**Objective:**

Identify the key factors that influence customer attrition (“Exited”) in the bank and suggest strategies to reduce churn.

**Data Cleaning:**

Standardized column names, converted blanks to NaN, imputed or dropped missing values, and engineered categorical bins for continuous variables.

**Data Analysis:**

Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to explore relationships between demographics, product usage, satisfaction, and churn.

**Data Visualization:**

Employed histograms, box plots, bar charts, and heatmaps (using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly) to reveal patterns and correlations.

**Insights:**

Discovered that low tenure, low satisfaction, inactive membership, and certain age/salary groups are strongly associated with higher churn rates.

**Deliverable:**

A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook with annotated code, clean datasets, interactive visualizations, and a slide deck summarizing key findings and recommendations.
